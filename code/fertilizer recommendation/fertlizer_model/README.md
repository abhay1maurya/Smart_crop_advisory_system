Here is the updated, comprehensive README.md file for your Fertilizer Recommendation System.

This documentation covers everything: the ensemble model architecture, the logic layer, installation steps, and how to run the full stack (API + Frontend).

# 🧪 Smart Fertilizer Advisory System

**AI-Powered Precision Nutrient Management for Agriculture**

This module is a high-performance machine learning system designed to recommend the optimal fertilizer for crops based on specific soil chemistry, crop type, and environmental conditions. It uses an **Ensemble Learning Architecture** (Voting Classifier with Random Forest & Gradient Boosting) to achieve superior accuracy and robustness.

Crucially, it includes a **"Farmer-Friendly Logic Layer"** that translates raw chemical predictions (like "Complex NPK") into actionable, specific advice (e.g., "Use Urea because your Nitrogen is low").

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Dual-Engine AI:** Combines the stability of **Random Forest** with the high precision of **HistGradientBoosting** in a Soft Voting Ensemble.
* **High Accuracy:** Achieves **~95.75%** accuracy on test data, robustly handling class imbalances.
* **Smart Logic Translator:** Automatically detects ambiguous predictions (e.g., "Complex NPK") and analyzes specific N-P-K levels to recommend the exact product needed (Urea vs DAP vs MOP).
* **Robust Preprocessing:** Includes scaling (StandardScaler) and feature order enforcement to prevent deployment crashes.
* **Microservice Architecture:** Lightweight **FastAPI** server running on Port 8001, ready for integration with Java/Spring Boot or React.

💻 Installation & Setup
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

2. Install Dependencies
Run this command to install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Generate the Model (First Run Only)
If fertilizer_model_final.pkl does not exist, open fertilizer_training.ipynb and run all cells to train and save the model.

⚡ Running the Application
Step 1: Start the API Server
This starts the Python microservice that hosts the AI model.

Bash

python fertilizer_api.py
Status: Server will start at http://127.0.0.1:8001

Swagger Docs: You can test the API directly at http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs

Step 2: Launch the Frontend
Simply double-click index_fertilizer.html to open it in your web browser.

It connects automatically to the Python API on Port 8001.

Fill in the soil details and click "Get Recommendation."

🧠 How the Logic Works
The system doesn't just output raw class labels. It applies a Post-Processing Logic Layer:

Prediction: The Ensemble model predicts the category (e.g., "Complex NPK").

Chemical Analysis: If the category is generic, the system checks specific N-P-K levels provided by the user:

If Nitrogen < 30: Override recommendation to UREA (46-0-0).

If Phosphorus < 30: Override recommendation to DAP (18-46-0).

If Potassium < 30: Override recommendation to MOP (0-0-60).

Translation: It maps synthetic dataset labels (like "120-60-60") into real-world advice ("High Yield NPK Mix").

📊 Model Performance
Algorithm: Soft Voting Ensemble (Random Forest + HistGradientBoosting)

Test Accuracy: 95.75%

Validation: Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation

Hard Class Performance: Achieved 78% F1-score on rare classes like "General Purpose Fertilizer," significantly outperforming single models.
